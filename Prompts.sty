I have the following project: 
"Project 2 (Individual Project)
 1. Take photos of the following items of two or more objects
( at least 100 instances for every object among all objects
and at least two classes for object detection):
a) utensils; b) laptop; c) mouse and keyboard
 2. Annotate them on annotation tool
 3. Train a Faster RCNN model (e.g. using detectron2)
 4. Train Yolov 4/5/6/7/8 (only one of them of choice).
 5. Evaluate both models based on mAP and speed and
size."

Compare YOLOv6 vs FasterRCNN, add some data augmentation types used, data distribtution, some results. The report needs to include an introduction to object detection, history of significant papers relevant to the topics mentioned earlier (look up relevant papers on these topics and cite them appropriately in the report), information about the dataset used, which is 100 images of utensils, laptops, and drinks each. Add various potential data augmentations that can be used for this dataset (search online and decide on the best kinds of data augmentations for this dataset to generate a larger dataset). Include that CVAT was used for annotation and explain the steps of annotating images with this tool. Include a few related tables comparing them, comparing MAP, MAP50, MAP75  of Yolo vs FastRCNN. Provide the entire detailed and comprehensive report in Latex format with 2-3 paragraphs for each section - make the report large and include any and all relevant details.
