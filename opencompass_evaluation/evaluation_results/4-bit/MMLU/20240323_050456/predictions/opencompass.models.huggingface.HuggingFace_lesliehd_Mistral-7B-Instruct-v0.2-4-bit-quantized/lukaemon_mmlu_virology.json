The first group of pathologists is aware of the race of the patient from whom the biopsy came, while the second group is blinded as to the patient’s race. The first group reports ‘hypertensive nephropathy’ much more frequently for black patients than the second group. Which of the following types of bias is most likely present in this study?\nA. Confounding\nB. Nonresponse bias\nC. Recall bias\nD. Referral bias\nAnswer: D",
