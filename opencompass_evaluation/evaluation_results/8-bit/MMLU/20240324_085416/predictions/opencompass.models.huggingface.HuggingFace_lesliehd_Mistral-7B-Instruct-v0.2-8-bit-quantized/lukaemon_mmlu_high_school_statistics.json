In surveying 50 basketball players, it is noted that the 25 who claim to study the most hours have a higher point average than the 25 who study less. Based on this study, the coach begins requiring the players to spend more time studying. Which of the following is a correct statement?\nA. While this study may have its faults, it still does prove causation.\nB. There could well be a confounding variable responsible for the seeming relationship.\nC. While this is a controlled experiment, the conclusion of the coach is not justified.\nD. To get the athletes to study more, it would be more meaningful to have them put in more practice time on the court to boost their point averages, as higher point averages seem to be associated with more study time.\nAnswer: D",
