Which of the following correctly states which phase of cellular respiration harvests the most energy and the correct explanation why?\nA. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it is here that pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2.\nB. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because in addition to the production of ATP, both FADH2 and NADH are produced. Each of those molecules will release 2 ATPs and 3 ATPs, respectively.\nC. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\nD. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because H2O is completely broken down into H+ and O2.\nAnswer: D",

To help submerge the leaves, a drop of soap is added to the water. How does the soap help submerge the leaf disks?\nA. The soap molecules enter through the stomata of the leaf and bond to oxygen molecules.\nB. The soap molecules bond to air bubbles on the surface of the leaf and remove them.\nC. The soap molecules decrease the pH of the water, allowing excess H+ to bond to the leaf surface.\nD. The hydrophobic regions of the soap molecules attach to the waxy leaf surface, while the hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules.\nAnswer: D",
