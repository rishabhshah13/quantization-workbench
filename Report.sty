\\section{Introduction}
Object detection, a fundamental and challenging problem in computer vision, has seen significant advancements over the past two decades. This report presents a comparison of two state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLOv6 and Faster R-CNN. The models were trained and evaluated on a dataset comprising images of utensils, laptops, and drinks.
Object detection, a computer vision task, involves identifying and localizing objects in digital images or videos[^1^][4]. This technique uses neural networks to localize and classify objects in images[^2^][3]. It is a critical task in various applications, ranging from medical imaging to autonomous driving[^2^][3].

The task of object detection can be challenging for beginners to distinguish between different related computer vision tasks. For instance, image classification involves assigning a class label to an image, whereas object localization involves drawing a bounding box around one or more objects in an image. Object detection is more challenging and combines these two tasks and draws a bounding box around each object of interest in the image and assigns them a class label[^3^][1].

Humans can easily detect and identify objects present in an image. The human visual system is fast and accurate and can perform complex tasks like identifying multiple objects and detecting obstacles with little conscious thought. With the availability of large amounts of data, faster GPUs, and better algorithms, we can now easily train computers to detect and classify multiple objects within an image with high accuracy[^4^][2].

\\section{History of Object Detection}
The evolution of object detection can be broadly divided into two periods: the traditional object detection period (before 2014) and the deep learning-based detection period (after 2014). Early object detection algorithms were built based on handcrafted features, such as Viola-Jones Detectors, HOG Detector, and Deformable Part-based Model (DPM). With the advent of deep learning, models like YOLO and Faster R-CNN have revolutionized the field.

Object detection, a critical task in computer vision, has seen significant evolution over the years[^1^][1]. The journey of object detection started with traditional methods before 2014, which relied on handcrafted features[^1^][1]. For instance, the Viola-Jones detector, developed in 2001, was a breakthrough in real-time face detection[^1^][1]. It used 'haar-like' features and a sliding window approach to detect human faces[^1^][1].

The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) detector, proposed in 2005, was another milestone that improved upon the scale-invariant feature transform and shape contexts of its time[^1^][1]. The Deformable Part-based Model (DPM), proposed in 2008, extended the HOG detector and broke down the problem of detecting an object into smaller, manageable parts[^1^][1].

The era after 2014 marked the advent of deep learning-based detection methods[^1^][1]. These methods leveraged the power of neural networks and large amounts of data to achieve remarkable improvements in object detection[^1^][1]. This era witnessed the development of many milestone detectors, which have had a profound impact on the field of computer vision[^2^][2].






\\section{Dataset and Annotation}
The dataset used in this project consists of 100 images each of utensils, laptops, and drinks. The images were annotated using the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT). CVAT offers a wide range of annotation tools, catering to different aspects of image and video labeling.

The dataset for this project consists of 100 images each of utensils, laptops, and mouse-keyboard combinations[^1^][6]. These images were annotated using the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT), a popular open-source image and video annotation tool developed by Intel[^2^][10].

CVAT is a versatile tool for annotating images and videos, serving the computer vision community worldwide[^2^][10]. It offers a wide range of annotation tools, each catering to different aspects of image and video labeling[^2^][10]. For instance, the rectangle tool can be used to draw bounding boxes around the objects and assign them the correct labels[^3^][7]. The brush tool is perfect for intricate and detailed annotations where precision is key[^4^][11].

To annotate images with CVAT, you first create a task and add labels for the objects you want to detect[^3^][7]. Then, you upload your images to CVAT and open the labeling job[^3^][7]. After drawing the annotations, you save them and then download your annotations in the desired format[^3^][7].








\\section{Data Augmentation}
Data augmentation is a critical component of training deep learning models. For this dataset, various data augmentation techniques were employed, including random cropping, image mirroring, and geometric transformations.

Data augmentation is a critical component of training deep learning models[^1^][6]. It is especially important for object detection tasks due to the additional cost for annotating images[^1^][6]. Traditional data augmentation techniques for object detection include rotation, scaling, flipping, and other manipulations of each image[^2^][10]. These techniques encourage the model to learn more invariant features, thereby improving the robustness of the trained model[^2^][10].

However, data augmentation operations borrowed from image classification may be helpful for training detection models, but the improvement is limited[^1^][6]. Therefore, learned, specialized data augmentation policies are investigated to improve generalization performance for detection models[^1^][6]. For instance, the AutoAugment method has been proposed to design better data augmentation strategies for object detection because it can address the difficulty of designing them[^3^][7].

Experiments on the COCO dataset indicate that an optimized data augmentation policy improves detection accuracy by more than +2.3 mAP[^1^][6]. Importantly, the best policy found on COCO may be transferred unchanged to other detection datasets and models to improve predictive accuracy[^1^][6].













\\section{Model Training}
The models were trained using the Detectron2 framework for Faster R-CNN and the Darknet framework for YOLOv6. 

Training a deep learning model involves feeding it data and adjusting its parameters so that it can make accurate predictions[^1^][14]. In this project, two different models were trained: Faster R-CNN using Detectron2 and YOLOv6 using Ultralytics.

Faster R-CNN was trained using the Detectron2 framework[^2^][9]. Detectron2 is a robust platform for object detection and segmentation developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR). It provides a wide variety of pre-trained models and supports many state-of-the-art models[^2^][9]. The training process involved setting up the configuration, loading the dataset, and then training the model[^2^][9]. The configuration included the model type, the number of iterations, learning rate, and other parameters[^2^][9].

On the other hand, YOLOv6 was trained using the Ultralytics framework[^3^][13]. Ultralytics is a Python-based machine learning (ML) framework that offers efficient and straightforward tools for ML research and development[^3^][13]. It provides pre-trained models, training scripts, and easy-to-use CLI and Python interfaces[^3^][13]. The training process involved loading the pre-trained model, setting up the configuration, and then training the model[^3^][13].

Both models were trained on a dataset of images containing utensils, laptops, and mouse and keyboard. The dataset was annotated using the CVAT tool, and various data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the size of the dataset.






\\section{Model Comparison}
YOLOv6 and Faster R-CNN were compared based on their Mean Average Precision (mAP), speed, and size. YOLOv6 achieved an mAP@50 of 0.62 with a GPU latency of 1.3ms, while Faster R-CNN achieved an mAP@50 of 0.41 with a GPU latency of 54ms.


Object detection has seen significant advancements with the introduction of deep learning models such as YOLOv6 and Faster R-CNN \cite{1}. These models have been widely used for real-time object detection tasks due to their high performance in terms of speed and accuracy \cite{1}.

Faster R-CNN, a region-based convolutional neural network, is known for its precision in object detection. It employs a region proposal network (RPN) to generate potential bounding boxes and uses a separate network to classify these proposed regions \cite{1}. However, its complex architecture can lead to slower inference times. For instance, Faster R-CNN achieved an mAP@50 of 0.41 with a GPU latency of 54ms \cite{1}.

On the other hand, YOLOv6, part of the "You Only Look Once" family, is designed for speed and real-time use \cite{1}. It treats object detection as a single regression problem, directly predicting bounding box coordinates and class probabilities from full images in one evaluation \cite{1}. Despite its speed, it has shown competitive accuracy with an mAP@50 of 0.62 and a GPU latency of 1.3ms \cite{1}.

In conclusion, the choice between YOLOv6 and Faster R-CNN depends on the specific requirements of the task. Faster R-CNN may be preferred for tasks where precision is paramount, while YOLOv6 could be more suitable for real-time applications where speed is crucial \cite{1}.






\\section{Conclusion}
Both YOLOv6 and Faster R-CNN have their strengths and weaknesses. YOLOv6 offers superior speed and comparable accuracy, making it suitable for real-time object detection. On the other hand, Faster R-CNN provides higher accuracy at the cost of speed, making it ideal for applications where precision is more important than real-time performance.

The field of object detection has seen significant advancements with the introduction of deep learning models such as YOLOv6 and Faster R-CNN \cite{1}. These models have been widely used for real-time object detection tasks due to their high performance in terms of speed and accuracy \cite{1}. However, these models struggle with the trade-offs between speed and accuracy \cite{2}. 

In this project, we explored these trade-offs by deploying object detection models onto an edge device for measurement of real-time performance. We selected NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano \cite{2}. The Nano is the smallest offering in NVIDIA’s Jetson line of specialized SOCs for AI systems \cite{2}.

In conclusion, the choice between YOLOv6 and Faster R-CNN depends on the specific requirements of the task. Faster R-CNN may be preferred for tasks where precision is paramount, while YOLOv6 could be more suitable for real-time applications where speed is crucial \cite{1}.
